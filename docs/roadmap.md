# Roadmap

Here's a list of upcoming features and improvements to enhance the capabilities and usability of the Motion Matching package for Unity:

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Enhanced Documentation**: Work on a more comprehensive guide explaining the intricacies of Motion Matching. For now, you can refer to the author's [master thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363377742_Motion_Matching_for_Character_Animation_and_Virtual_Reality_Avatars_in_Unity).

- [ ] **Trajectory and Pose Feature Customization**: Implement a more user-friendly system for modifying trajectory features, and expand the types of pose features available.

- [ ] **Motion Capture Library**: Record additional motion capture data and create default avatars for immediate use in projects.

- [ ] **PathCharacterController Upgrades**: Revise the current hardcoded path tools in favor of a more flexible system, possibly using splines or other advanced techniques.

- [ ] **Visual Debugging Tools**: Develop a suite of visual debugging tools for easier inspection and adjustment during development.

- [ ] **Memory Optimization with Deep Learning**: Investigate the use of deep learning algorithms to reduce memory usage in the system.

## Completed Features

- [x] **BVH Editor with Tagging**: Introduced a BVH editor that supports real-time complex tag queries.
  
- [x] **Unity Animation System Integration**: Added tools and methods for seamless integration with Unity's native animation system. This allows, for example, the use of Unity's animation system for the upper body while utilizing Motion Matching for the lower body.

- [x] **Unity Package Structure**: Successfully restructured the project into a Unity package for easier distribution and integration.

Your contributions and suggestions are always welcome as we continue to develop this project into a comprehensive Motion Matching solution for Unity.
